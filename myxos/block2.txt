Setting Up



    Download th
e complete pack
age. Go to down
loads page.

    Copy the ta
r file to your 
home directory.


    cp myxos.ta
r.gz $HOME/

    Extract the
 contents using
 the command.

    tar -xvf my
xos.tar.gz

    Now you wil
l have a direct
ory myxos in yo
ur home drector
y, with all com
ponents require
d for building 
your own XOS

    Change dire
ctory to myxos 
directory

    cd $HOME/my
xos

    Make sure a
ll the prerequi
sites which inc
lude gcc, flex/
lex and bison/y
acc are install
ed.

    In Ubuntu/D
ebian systems, 
use apt to inst
all flex and bi
son.

    sudo apt-ge
t install flex 
bison

    Make to bui
ld all the comp
onents.

    make



If the setup wo
rked correctly,
 the following 
executables wil
l be created



    spl in $HOM

SPL Compiler

Introduction



SPL Compiler (S
ystem Programme
r‚Äôs Language 
Compiler) is us
ed in the imple
mentation of an
 operating syst
em on XSM (eXpe
rimental String
 Machine). The 
compiler compil
es the code wri
tten in SPL and
 translates it 
into machine co
de which is sim
ulated on the m
achine. SPL spe
cification is a
vailable here.

Installation

Prerequisites



    GCC (GNU pr
oject C and C++
 compiler)



    Flex / Lex 
(Fast Lexical A
nalyser Generat
or)



    Bison / Yac
c (GNU Project 
Parser Generato
r)





Running



Within your spl
 directory, use
 the following 
commands to run
 the SPL compil
er



    ./spl flag 
path-to-spl-pro
gram



Flags

Any one of thes
e flags is requ
ired to compile
.



    --os : Comp
ile OS Code. Th
e compiled outp
ut filename wil
l be os_startup
.xsm



    --int=timer
 : Compile Time
r Interrupt cod
e. The compiled
 output filenam
e will be timer
.xsm



    --int=[1-7]
 : Compile Inte
rrupt routines.
 The compiled o
utput filename 
will be int1.xs
m, int2.xsm...



    --exhandler
 : Compile Exce
ption Handler. 
The compiled ou
tput filename w
ill be exhandle
r.xsm



Example Usage



cd $HOME/myxos/
spl 

./spl --os samp
les/hello-world
.spl 



A file os_start
up.xsm is creat
ed in $HOME/myx
os/spl/samples/

APL Compiler

Introduction



APL Compiler (A
pplication Prog
rammer‚Äôs Lang
uage Compiler) 
is used to writ
e programs whic
h can be run on
 XOS (eXperimen
tal Operating S
ystem). The com
piler compiles 
the program wri
tten in APL and
 translates it 
into machine co
de which is sim
ulated on the m
achine. APL spe
cification is a
vailable here.

Installation

Prerequisites



    GCC (GNU pr
oject C and C++
 compiler)



    Flex / Lex 
(Fast Lexical A
nalyser Generat
or)



    Bison / Yac
c (GNU Project 
Parser Generato
r)





Running



Within your APL
 directory, use
 the following 
commands to run
 the APL compil
er



    ./apl path-
to-file



The output file
 will be in the
 same location 
as the input fi
le and filename
 will be same w
ith the extensi
on changed to x
sm. For example
 if input file 
is prime.apl, o
utput file is p
rime.xsm



Example Usage



cd $HOME/myxos/
apl 

./apl samples/l
argest.apl



The file larges
t.apl is a samp
le APL program 
which finds lar
gest of 4 numbe
rs. This progra
m is compiled t
o $HOME/myxos/a
pl/samples/larg
est.xsm.

XFS Interface

Introduction



XFS Interface (
eXperimental Fi
le System Inter
face) is an ext
ernal interface
 to access the 
filesystem of t
he XOS. The fil
esystem is simu
lated on a bina
ry file called 
disk.xfs. The i
nterface can fo
rmat the disk, 
load/remove fil
es, list files 
and copy blocks
 to a UNIX file
. See Filesyste
m specification
.

Installation

Prerequisites



    GCC (GNU pr
oject C and C++
 compiler)





Running



Within your xfs
-interface dire
ctory, use the 
following comma
nds to run the 
interface



    ./xfs-inter
face



top ‚Üë

Commands



Type the comman
d help in the i
nterface to dis
play the list o
f commands.

Format the disk




The command fdi
sk is used to c
reate the disk 
(‚Äùdisk.xfs‚Äù
) or to format 
the disk if alr
eady created. O
n a newly creat
ed disk or form
atted disk the 
Disk Free List 
and FAT entries
 are initialize
d.

     Syntax: fd
isk

Load Files



The command loa
d is used to lo
ad files from t
he UNIX filesys
tem to the XFS 
disk. The type 
of the file tha
t is loaded is 
specified by th
e first argumen
t. The second a
rgument <pathna
me> is the path
 to the UNIX fi
le which is to 
be loaded to th
e filesystem.

The command che
cks the size of
 the file (exec
utable or data 
files) and allo
cates blocks to
 it. A correspo
nding FAT entry
 is created for
 the file. For 
the OS startup 
code, interrupt
 routines and e
xception handle
r, the file is 
loaded to the c
orresponding lo
cation in the d
isk ( Refer dis
k organization 
).



    Syntax: loa
d --exec <pathn
ame>

         Loads 
an executable f
ile to XFS disk




    Syntax: loa
d --init <pathn
ame>

         Loads 
INIT code to XF
S disk



    Syntax: loa
d --data <pathn
ame>

         Loads 
a data file to 
XFS disk



    Syntax: loa
d --os <pathnam
e>

         Loads 
OS startup code
 to XFS disk



    Syntax: loa
d --int=timer <
pathname>

         Loads 
Timer Interrupt
 routine to XFS
 disk



    Syntax: loa
d --int=[1-7] <
pathname>

         Loads 
the specified I
nterrupt routin
e to XFS disk



    Syntax: loa
d --exhandler <
pathname>

         Loads 
exception handl
er routine to X
FS disk



Remove Files



The command rm 
is used to remo
ve files from t
he filesystem. 
The first argum
ent specifies t
he type of file
 to be removed.
 The argument <
xfs_filename> s
pecifies the fi
le which is to 
be removed.

The command sea
rches the FAT e
ntries for the
