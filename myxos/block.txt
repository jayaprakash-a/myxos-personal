List Files



The command ls 
lists all the f
iles which are 
loaded into the
 filesystem. Th
e size of the f
ile is also dis
played in numbe
r of words. The
 FAT entries ar
e traversed and
 all the files 
and their corre
sponding sizes 
are displayed.

     Syntax: ls


Display Disk Fr
ee List



The command df 
displays the di
sk free list. I
t also displays
 the total numb
er of blocks an
d the number of
 free blocks.

     Syntax: df


Display File co
ntents



The command cat
 displays the c
ontents of a fi
le in the files
ystem. The FAT 
entries are sea
rched to get th
e blocks corres
ponding to the 
file. The block
s are displayed
.

     Syntax: ca
t <xfs_filename
>

Copy disk block
s to a UNIX fil
e



The command cop
y copies the co
ntents of speci
fied blocks in 
the filesystem 
to an external 
UNIX file. The 
arguments <star
t_block> and <e
nd_block> denot
es the range of
 blocks to be c
opied (includin
g both). <unix_
filename> speci
fes the destina
tion UNIX file 
to which the co
ntents are copi
ed to.

     Syntax: co
py <start_block
> <end_block> <
unix_filename>

Display help



The command hel
p displays the 
general syntax 
and function of
 all the comman
ds.

     Syntax: he
lp

Exit Interface



The command exi
t quits the int
eface.

     Syntax: ex
it

Example Usage

To load a file 
os_startup.xsm 
( which you cre
ated using SPL 
compiler ) loca
ted in $HOME/my
xos/spl into th
e xfs filesyste
m



cd $HOME/myxos/
xfs-interface

./xfs-interface




This will show 
the xfs-interfa
ce. First issue
 a fdisk comman
d. This will cr
eate a disk.xfs
 file in the di
rectory $HOME/m
yxos/xfs-interf
ace. This file 
simulates the h
ard disk for XS
M (Machine Simu
lator).

fdisk

Now use the loa
d command to lo
ad the os_start
up.xsm.

load --os $HOME
/myxos/spl/samp
les/os_startup.
xsm

If you want to 
see whether loa
d command works
 properly, copy
 the block 0 (f
rom 0 to 0) in 
disk.xfs back t
o a unix file, 
say $HOME/myxos
/xfs-interface/
test

copy 0 0 $HOME/
myxos/xfs-inter
face/test

Now open test t
o see the conte
nts of os_start
up.xsm

XSM Simulator

Introduction



The XSM Simulat
or (eXperimenta
l String Machin
e) is used to s
imulate the XSM
 hardware. See 
Machine Specifi
cation

Installation

Prerequisites



    GCC (GNU pr
oject C and C++
 compiler)



    Flex / Lex 
(Fast Lexical A
nalyser Generat
or)



    Bison / Yac
c (GNU Project 
Parser Generato
r)





Running



Within your XSM
 directory, use
 the following 
command to run 
the simulator



    ./xsm flag



Flags



    --debug : T
his flag sets t
he machine into
 DEBUG mode whe
n it encounters
 a BRKP machine
 instruction. F
urther details 
are given in th
e section below
.



    --timer=val
ue : This flag 
sets the number
 of instruction
s after which t
imer interrupt 
is triggered to
 value. --timer
=0 disables the
 timer. The ran
ge of value is 
from 0 to 1024



Debugging



The --debug fla
g is used to de
bug the running
 machine. When 
this flag is se
t and the machi
ne encounters a
 breakpoint ins
truction, it is
 set into the D
EBUG mode. In t
his mode a prom
pt is displayed
 which allows t
he user to ente
r commands to i
nspect the stat
e of the machin
e.



The commands in
 DEBUG mode are




    step / s :

    The executi
on proceeds by 
a single step



    continue / 
c :

    The executi
on proceeds til
l the next brea

<register_name_
1> :

ol Block of the
 process with t
he state as RUN
NING.

ol Block of the
 process with t
he given <pid>.

 the location p
ointed by PTBR 
(Page Table Bas
e Register).

    Sets a watc
h point to this
 address. Watch
 point is used 
to track change
